# DFS-implementation
DFS with a binary tree.

This is a very simple implementation of a Depth-First Search using a Binary Tree data structure. The objective of this program is to traverse through the 
entire tree and visit and print all nodes.

The binary tree is manually created and we will implement
the following traversal methonds: 
1. Inorder Traversal
2. Postorder Traversal
3. Preorder Traversal

This will print out all the nodes in our binary tree to the console.


To run this, simply copy and paste the code or clone the repository to your system and use your favourite IDE and hit run!
